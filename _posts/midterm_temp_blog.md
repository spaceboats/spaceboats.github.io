## Applications

In addition to busbus core, we wanted to show real world uses of the busbus 
platform. Our end users are developers, so we needed some kind of real world 
application to showcase how to use busbus. This lead us to choosing the three 
applications that are most likely going to be made with this platform. An 
android app, a web application, and a LED board.

# Android app

No one in the group had any experience with android development, so there was 
a learning curve. After a few weeks, we started to gain the appropriate 
knowledge of the android app lifecycle, and how to pass data back and forth 
between different activities and fragments. Due to time contraints and lack of 
android knowledge, we elected to only support android 5 for our app. Android 5 
introduced many new libraries, including one that we used called 
[RecyclerView][rc_view]. 
Google introduced the [material design specifications][mat_design] with 
Android 5 as well. This sepcification is designed to help developers pick 
good design decisions when creating animation and color schemes. We wanted 
to mock what a real android developer would be doing, so we made sure to 
follow these specifications.
